Business Objectives:

Predicting Loss Given Default (LGD): The primary business objective is to develop a predictive model for Loss Given Default (LGD) for defaulted accounts. LGD represents the proportion of the exposure that a lender is unable to recover after a borrower defaults. Accurate prediction of LGD is crucial for risk management and financial planning.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the predictive model based on a defined performance metric. The performance metric should align with business goals and accurately measure the model's effectiveness in predicting LGD.

Understanding Data Sets: Gain a deep understanding of the provided data sets, including variables, data types, and distributions. Recognize the relevance of each variable to LGD prediction. This understanding is essential for building a meaningful and accurate model.

Data Aggregation and Merging: Aggregate and merge relevant information from the collection data set to enhance the predictive power of the model. The merged data should provide comprehensive insights into the factors affecting LGD.

Data Types and Quality: Ensure accurate identification of variable data types to prevent datatype mismatch errors. Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, or any issues that might negatively impact the model's performance.

Feature Engineering and Extraction: Conduct feature engineering and extraction to create new variables that could enhance the model's predictive capabilities. Introduce features that capture the intricacies of defaulted accounts and contribute to a more accurate LGD prediction.
